# ESP32 GPS Receiver
One of the most exciting experiments is to get the current position by a Global Positioning System, or "GPS" in short. This tutorial will show an easy way to get a lot of data from satellites that are some hundred kilometers above our head. All you need for this is an ESP32 Development Board and a GPS module (here an uBlox NEO-6M or NEO-7M).

This is an accompanying repository for the article "Get GPS Position Data with a uBlox NEO-6M or NEO-7M module and ESP32 development boards", available on medium.com here:
